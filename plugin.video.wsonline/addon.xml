        <description>Get the latest TV episodes on Watchseries-Online(.pl/.nl/.la...) and search for a series, list all online
            episodes in that series, and play them from Openload.Co or VODlocker
            [B]V1.6.0 2017-4-5:[/B] Minor fixes/changes to make Save Show and Remove show work better. Make Search Show work as currently doesn't. V1.5 2017-2-20: Parsers have been added to attempt to grab details out of the name of the show such as the date, episode number and season. Formats the listings to be standard for easy sorting and reading through including color to make date stand out. V1.2.0 2018-02-14: New playback and video file resolving fixing many bugs. Source Sorting and fave sources can be set in settings. Updated to new watchseries-online host which is currently .PL and added this as a setting that can be changed in the addon so I don't have to release an update each time they move servers.
